Welcome to the github repository for my internship at the Pediatric Precision Oncology Lab (PPOL) Ghent.
The purpose of the internship is to do a shiny app development of single cell RNA sequencing data of iPSC models.
To get a biological backround for the app, the published paper can be found in the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223021739.
To get familiar with shiny app development and working with single cell RNA sequencing data, i did tutorials on https://shiny.posit.co/ and https://satijalab.org/seurat/.
My code from these tutorials and there exercises can be found in the folders Shiny_exercises and Seurat_exercises.
For trying to deploy my app I used Docker Desktop, the exercises from the tutorials can be found in the folder DockerDesktop_exercises.
